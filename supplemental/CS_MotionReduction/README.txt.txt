Each video has two parts: the distorted video on the top, and the restored video at the bottom. A few set of corresponding points are shown in both videos. The root mean squared displacement values (denoted as \sigma here and in the videos) around the mean position are printed around each point. That is

\sigma = \sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^N ||d_i||^2/N }

One can observe the significant reduction in motion due to the Fourier method, both numerically and visually.
